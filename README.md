# ChE 211: Optimization Methods in Chemical Engineering

Instructors: Karl Ezra Pilario, Ph.D. and Jhud Mikhail Aberilla, Ph.D.

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our course. 

ChE 211 is a graduate-level course offered in the Department of Chemical Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman, that aims to teach students optimization theory and its applications in our field.

The course covers mathematical programming (LP, MILP, NLP, MINLP) and their solutions using zero-order, first-order, and second-order methods. Students are taught skills in formulating optimization problems and how to code them in solvers such as those in Python (Pyomo, Pyomo DAE, IPOPT) and MATLAB (fminunc, fmincon). The course also includes topics on nature-inspired algorithms, optimization with differential equation constraints, graph theory and graph algorithms, Bayesian Optimization, and surrogate-based optimization.  

This repository contains lecture slides, Python codes (Jupyter notebooks and MATLAB scripts), case studies, and datasets used in class.
